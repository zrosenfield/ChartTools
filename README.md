# ChartTools    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zrosenfield/ChartTools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mhe/pynrrd)
Tools for building better charts

## What is it for
Great insights on top of data should be easy.  There are lots of great charting libraries out there (D3, HighCharts, AMCharts; just to name a few); but adding trendlines, adding forecasts, and manipulating data formats can be tricky.  ChartTools is here to make it easy to add:

 - Trends
 - Forecasts
 - Seasonality

## Get Started
